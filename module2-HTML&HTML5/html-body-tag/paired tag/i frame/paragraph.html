    <p>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the backbone of the internet, providing the structure and content that makes up a website. Developed by Tim Berners-Lee in 1989, HTML has undergone several revisions, with the most recent version being HTML5. This markup language uses a series of tags and attributes to define the different elements of a web page, such as headings, paragraphs, images, and links. With its simplicity and versatility, HTML has become the standard language for building websites, and is an essential skill for anyone looking to pursue a career in webÂ development.</p>
